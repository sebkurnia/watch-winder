# Notes

The daysPerMonth array is made for calculation of a so-called ultimateMin,
which essentially adds minutes elapsed depending on the status of the real-
time clock. See the getMonth and calcUltimateMin methods for a better idea
of how this system works. 

Note also that the stepper does not move in 'turns' but rather in discrete steps.
